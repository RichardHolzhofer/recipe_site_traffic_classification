    "#### Problem statement:\n",
    "The marketing department selects a recipe each day to post on the homepage of the company's website. They have noticed that traffic to the rest of the website increases by as much as 40% if they pick a popular recipe. Since high traffic leads to more subscriptions to the company's services, they want to maximize traffic to their website.\n",
    "Currently, they don't know how to determine whether a recipe will be popular, so they want a reliable solution that can select popular recipes at least 80% of the time."
